# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

For this challenge, I used the weather description data I've already retrieved previously to enhance the PlanMyTrip app to enbale beta testers to use the input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
